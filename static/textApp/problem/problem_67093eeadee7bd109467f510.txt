"The table below shows the amount of money, in dollars, that Kathy earns babysitting for a given number of hours worked.\n\nBABYSITTING EARNINGS\n\n| Number of <br> Hours, $\\boldsymbol{h}$ | Earnings, $\\boldsymbol{d}$ <br> (dollars) |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| 4 | $\\$ 50.00$ |\n| 5 | $\\$ 62.50$ |\n| 6 | $\\$ 75.00$ |\n| 9 | $\\$ 112.50$ |\n\nBased on the table, which statement is true about the relationship between the number of hours, $h$, she works and the amount of money, $d$, she earns?\n\nA It is not proportional because when the value of $h$ is 0 , the value of $d$ is 0 .\n\nB It is proportional because the ratios between the values of $d$ and $h$ are the same for each pair.\n\nC It is not proportional because the difference between $d$ and $h$ is different for each pair of values.\n\nD It is proportional because the values of $h$ increase by the same amount from one pair of values to the next."
