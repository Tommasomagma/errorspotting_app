"This question is worth 2 credits.\n\nA student programs a robot to travel at a constant speed across the classroom floor. The table below represents the relationship between the distance, in feet, the robot travels over a period of time, in seconds.\n\n## DISTANCE ROBOT TRAVELED\n\n| Time, $\\boldsymbol{t}$ <br> (seconds) | Distance, $\\boldsymbol{d}$ <br> (feet) |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| 2 | 1 |\n| 4 | 2 |\n| 10 | 5 |\n| 16 | 8 |\n\nWrite an equation to represent the distance, $d$, in feet, the robot travels in $t$ seconds. Using the equation, how many seconds will it take for the robot to travel 11 feet?\n\nShow your work.\n\nAnswer seconds"
