"Vad Ã¤r $x$?". Problem image: The image displays a straight line labeled MOP with points M, O, and P aligned horizontally. A secondary line begins at point N above O and intersects the line MOP at point O, forming two angles at O. The larger angle with the straight line is marked as 136 degrees, and the smaller angle between the secondary line and the straight line is labeled with an 'x' to represent its unknown degree measure. The region between the secondary line and the straight line is shaded, indicating the angle associated with 'x' degrees.
